# Aarushi Sharma â€“ Data Analyst Portfolio  
*Data Analyst | Skilled in SQL, Python, BI Tools | Bridging data and decision-making with clarity and precision* 

## About  
Hi, Iâ€™m Aarushi! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Data Analyst who thrives on exploring data to solve problems and uncover stories hidden within numbers. My work focuses on creating clear, evidence-based insights that help organizations make smarter decisions.

I specialize in data visualization, statistical analysis, and data storytelling, with hands-on experience in Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Excel, and Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Whether itâ€™s designing dashboards, analyzing customer behavior, or testing business hypotheses, I enjoy breaking down complex data into solutions that drive measurable results.

Iâ€™m continuously learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques to sharpen my analytical edge. What excites me most is the challenge of turning messy datasets into meaningful outcomes that make a tangible impact.

## Portfolio Projects  

### Customer Churn Analysis  
**Goal:** To analyze customer churn patterns and identify key factors influencing customer retention.  

**Description:**  
This project uses the **Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset** to investigate why customers discontinue services. The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, and additional service usage.  

The analysis involved:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python (visuals, correlations, distributions)  
- Hypothesis testing to understand the statistical significance of churn factors  
- Visualization of insights through charts and graphs  
- Recommendations for reducing churn  

**Key Insights:**  
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** had the highest churn rates.  
- **Electronic check payments** were strongly linked to higher churn compared to automatic payments.  
- Adding multiple streaming services showed **diminishing returns** in reducing churn.  
- Longer tenure and bundled services contributed to better customer retention.  

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL.  

**Results:**  
The analysis revealed that contract type and payment method are the strongest predictors of churn. Recommendations included encouraging customers to switch to long-term contracts, offering bundled services, and incentivizing automated payments to improve retention rates.

### Business Requirement Document â€“ Electric Vehicles  
**Goal:** To define business requirements for an Electric Vehicle (EV) analytics project.  

**Description:**  
Developed a **Business Requirement Document (BRD)** capturing project objectives, scope, stakeholders, functional and non-functional requirements, and success metrics. The document highlights how analytics can track EV adoption, usage patterns, and operational performance.  

**Skills:** Requirement gathering, business analysis, documentation, process mapping.  
**Technology:** MS Word, Lucidchart (for diagrams).  

**Results:**  
A clear, structured BRD that can serve as the foundation for implementing EV-focused analytics solutions.
