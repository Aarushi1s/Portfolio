## Portfolio Projects  

### **1) Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI (Dashboard Project)**
**Goal:** To build an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer churn patterns and enable business stakeholders to explore key drivers of churn visually.

**Description:**  
This project uses the **Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset** to investigate why customers discontinue services. The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, and additional service usage.  

This project uses the **Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset** to create a dynamic and user-friendly Power BI report that helps stakeholders understand:  
- Overall churn rate  
- Customer segmentation  
- Impact of contract type and payment method  
- Relationship between tenure and churn  
- Service usage patterns  

**Key Metrics (DAX & KPIs Used) :**
- Total Customers  
- Total Churned Customers  
- Churn Rate (%)  
- Retention Rate (%)  
- Average Tenure  
- Average Monthly Charges  
- Churn by Contract Type (%)  
- Churn by Payment Method (%)  

**Dashboard Pages**  

**Overview Page:**  
- Total customers  
- Churn rate (%)  
- Retention rate (%)  
- Key KPI cards  

**Churn Analysis Page:**  
- Churn by contract type  
- Churn by payment method  
- Churn distribution across tenure groups  

**Customer Insights:**  
- Breakdown by demographics (Senior citizen, Partner, Dependents)  
- Service usage vs churn (Streaming, Internet type, Tech support, etc.)  

**Key Insights from Power BI Dashboard:**  
- Month-to-month contracts showed the highest churn.  
- Electronic check users had significantly higher churn.  
- Longer customer tenure correlated with lower churn.  
- Customers with bundled services were more likely to stay.

**Skills:** Data visualization, DAX, data modeling, dashboard design, business analytics.  
**Technology:** Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Visualizations)

### **2) Customer Churn Analysis – Python (EDA & Statistical Analysis)**  

**Goal:**  To analyze customer churn patterns and identify key factors influencing customer retention using Python.

**Description:**  
This project uses the **Kaggle Telco Customer Churn dataset** to investigate why customers discontinue services. The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, and additional service usage.

**The analysis involved**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python (visuals, correlations, distributions)  
- Hypothesis testing to understand the statistical significance of churn factors  
- Visualization of insights through charts and graphs  
- Business recommendations to reduce churn  

**Key Insights**
- Customers on month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rates.  
- Electronic check payments were strongly linked to higher churn compared to automatic payments.  
- Adding multiple streaming services showed diminishing returns in reducing churn.  
- Longer tenure and bundled services contributed to better customer retention.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
**Technology:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### **3) Business Requirement Document – Electric Vehicles**

**Goal:** To define business requirements for an Electric Vehicle (EV) analytics project.  

**Description:**  
Developed a **Business Requirement Document (BRD)** capturing project objectives, scope, stakeholders, functional and non-functional requirements, and success metrics. The document highlights how analytics can track EV adoption, usage patterns, and operational performance.  

**Skills:** Requirement gathering, business analysis, documentation, process mapping.  
**Technology:** MS Word, Lucidchart (for diagrams).  

**Results:**  
A clear, structured BRD that can serve as the foundation for implementing EV-focused analytics solutions.
